Titan Workflow Series
======================

The Titan Workflow Series is a collection of WDL workflows developed for performing genomic characterization and genomic epidemiology of viral samples to support public health decision-making. As of today (May 4th, 2021) these workflows are specific to SARS-CoV-2 amplicon read data, but work is underway to allow for the analysis of other viral pathogens of concern.


Titan Workflows for Genomic Characterization
--------------------------------------------
Genomic characterization, *i.e.* generating consensus assemblies (FASTA format) from next-generation sequencing (NGS) read data (FASTQ format) to assign samples with relevant nomenclature designation (e.g. PANGO lineage and NextClade clades) is an increasingly critical function to public health laboratories around the world.

The Titan Series includes four separate WDL workflows (Titan_Illumina_PE, Titan_Illumina_SE, Titan_ClearLabs, and Titan_ONT) that process NGS read data from four different sequencing approaches: Illumina paired-end, Illumina single-end, Clear Labs, and Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT)) to generate consensus assemblies, produce relevant quality-control metrics for both the input read data and the generated assembly, and assign samples with a lineage and clade designation using Pangolin and NextClade, respectively.

All four Titan workflows for genomic characterization will generate a viral assembly by mapping input read data to a reference genome, removing primer reads from that alignment, and then calling the consensus assembly based on the primer-trimmed alignment. These consensus assemblies are then fed into the Pangolin and NextClade CLI tools for lineage and clade assignments.

The major difference between each of these Titan workflows is in how the read mapping, primer trimming, and consensus genome calling is performed. More information on the technical details of these processes and information on how to utilize and apply these workflows for public health investigations is available below.

A series of introductory training videos that provide conceptual overviews of methodologies and walkthrough tutorials on how to utilize these Titan workflows through Terra are available on the Theiagen Genomics YouTube page:

Titan_Illumina_PE
=================
The Titan_Illumina_PE workflow was written to process Illumina paired-end (PE) read data. Input reads are assumed to be the product of sequencing tiled PCR-amplicons designed for the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The most common read data analyzed by the Titan_Illumina_PE workflow are generated with the Artic V3 protocol. Alternative primer schemes such as the Qiaseq Primer Panel, however, can also be analysed with this workflow. The primer sequence coordinates of the PCR scheme utilized must be provided along with the raw paired-end Illumina read data in BED and FASTQ file formats, respectively. 

.. note::
  By default, this workflow will assume that input reads were generated using a 300-cycle kit (i.e. 2 x 150 bp reads). Modifications to the optional parameter for trimmomatic_minlen may be required to accommodate for shorter read data, such as 2 x 75bp reads generated using a 150-cycle kit.
  
Upon initiating a Titan_Illumina_PE job, the input primer scheme coordinates and raw paired-end Illumina read data provided for each sample will be processed to perform consensus genome assembly, infer the quality of both raw read data and the generated consensus genome, and assign samples SARS-CoV-2 lineage and clade types as outlined in the Titan_Illumina_PE data workflow below.

   **Titan_Illumina_PE v1.4.2 Data Workflow**

Consensus genome assembly with the Titan_Illumina_PE workflow is performed by first trimming low-quality reads with Trimmomatic and removing adapter sequences with BBDuk.  These cleaned read data are then aligned to the Wuhan-1 reference genome with BWA to generate a Binary Alignment Mapping (BAM) file. Primer sequences are then removed from the BAM file using the iVar Trim sub-command. The iVar consensus sub-command is then  utilized to generate a consensus assembly in FASTA format. This assembly is then used to assign lineage and clade designations with Pangolin and NextClade. NCBI’S VADR tool is also employed to screen for potentially errant features (e.g. erroneous frame-shift mutations) in the consensus assembly.

Titan_Illumina_SE
=================
The Titan_Illumina_SE workflow was written to process Illumina single-end (SE) read data. Input reads are assumed to be the product of sequencing tiled PCR-amplicons designed for the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The most common read data analyzed by the Titan_Illumina_SE workflow are generated with the Artic V3 protocol. Alternative primer schemes such as the Qiaseq Primer Panel, however, can also be analysed with this workflow. The primer sequence coordinates of the PCR scheme utilized must be provided along with the raw paired-end Illumina read data in BED and FASTQ file formats, respectively. 

.. note::
  By default, this workflow will assume that input reads were generated using a 35-cycle kit (i.e. 1 x 35 bp reads). Modifications to the optional parameter for trimmomatic_minlen may be required to accommodate for longer read data.
  
Upon initiating a Titan_Illumina_SE job, the input primer scheme coordinates and raw paired-end Illumina read data provided for each sample will be processed to perform consensus genome assembly, infer the quality of both raw read data and the generated consensus genome, and assign samples SARS-CoV-2 lineage and clade types as outlined in the Titan_Illumina_PE data workflow below.

Titan_ClearLabs
=================
The Titan_ClearLabs workflow was written to process ClearLabs WGS read data for SARS-CoV-2 Artic V3 amplicon sequencing. 

Upon initiating a Titan_ClearLabs run,  input ClearLabs read data provided for each sample will be processed to perform consensus genome assembly, infer the quality of both raw read data and the generated consensus genome, and assign samples SARS-CoV-2 lineage and clade types as outlined in the Titan_ClearLabs data workflow below.

   :width: 800
   :alt: Titan_ClearLabs workflow
   :figclass: align-center
   
   **Titan_ClearLabs v1.4.2 Data Workflow**

Consensus genome assembly with the Titan_ClearLabs workflow is performed in accordance to the `Artic nCoV-2019 novel coronavirs bioinformatics protocol <https://artic.network/ncov-2019/ncov2019-bioinformatics-sop.html>`. Briefly, input reads are aligned to the Wuhan-1 reference genome with minimap2 to generate a Binary Alignment Mapping (BAM) file. Primer sequences are then removed from the BAM file and a consensus assembly file is generated using the Artic medaka command. This assembly is then used to assign lineage and clade designations with Pangolin and NextClade. NCBI’S VADR tool is also employed to screen for potentially errant features (e.g. erroneous frame-shift mutations) in the consensus assembly.  

.. note::
  Read-trimming is performed on raw read data generated on the ClearLabs instrument and thus not a required step in the Titan_ClearLabs workflow.

Titan_ONT
=========
The Titan_ONT workflow was written to process basecalled and demultiplexed Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) read data. IInput reads are assumed to be the product of sequencing Artic V3 tiled PCR-amplicons designed for the SARS-CoV-2 genome.  

.. note::
  As of May 2021, alternative primer schemes are not currently supported for the Titan_ONT workflow, but active development us underway to allow for such analysis in the near future.
  
Upon initiating a Titan_ONT run,  input ONT read data provided for each sample will be processed to perform consensus genome assembly, infer the quality of both raw read data and the generated consensus genome, and assign samples SARS-CoV-2 lineage and clade types as outlined in the Titan_ONT data workflow below.

   **Titan_ONT v1.4.2 Data Workflow**

Consensus genome assembly with the Titan_ONT workflow is performed in accordance to the `Artic nCoV-2019 novel coronavirs bioinformatics protocol <https://artic.network/ncov-2019/ncov2019-bioinformatics-sop.html>`. Briefly, input reads are filtered by size (min-length: 400bp; max-length: 700bp) with the Aritc guppyplex command.  These size-selected read data are aligned to the Wuhan-1 reference genome with minimap2 to generate a Binary Alignment Mapping (BAM) file. Primer sequences are then removed from the BAM file and a consensus assembly file is generated using the Artic medaka command. This assembly is then used to assign lineage and clade designations with Pangolin and NextClade. NCBI’S VADR tool is also employed to screen for potentially errant features (e.g. erroneous frame-shift mutations) in the consensus assembly.
