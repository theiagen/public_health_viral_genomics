About Theiagen
=============

**Our Mission:** Together, we will transform public health and infectious disease surveillance through the innovative implementation of NGS and bioinformatics technologies.

**Who we are:** We are public health scientists committed to improving infectious disease surveillance, food safety, molecular diagnostics, and environmental monitoring. 

* We bring expertise from previous academia, government, and industry careers working on diverse projects in infectious disease, cancer, biofuels, and strain engineering. 
* Our experience provides us with a “lean forward” perspective.
* We continually strive to push the innovative implementation of technology as efficiently as possible since time is our most valuable resource.

**What we believe:** NGS technologies used to be the domain of large academic or government research groups. Advances in sequencing technology and cloud computing have produced the “democratization” of NGS and bioinformatics. This democratization allows any clinical, environmental, or food safety organization, regardless of size and resources, to take advantage of these technologies to advance their core business. Results are quicker, more affordable, and have higher resolution and accuracy than ever before.
