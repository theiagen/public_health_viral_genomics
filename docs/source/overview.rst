Public Health Viral Genomics
============================

The Theiagen Public Health Viral Genomics repository hosts a collection of WDL workflows for genomic characterization, submission preparation, and genomic epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. While these workflows can be run locally or on an HPC system at the command-line with Cromwell or miniWDL, we strongly recommend use through `Terra <https://app.terra.bio/>`_, a bioinformatics web application developed by the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in collaboration with Microsoft and Verily Life Sciences .

Getting Started
---------------

A series of introductory training videos that provide conceptual overviews of methodologies and walkthrough tutorials on how to utilize our WDL workflows through Terra are available through the Theiagen Genomics YouTube page:
